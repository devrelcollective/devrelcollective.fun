## A Working definition of DevRel

We define a "DevRel Practitioner" as one who performs the functions of "Dev Advocates / Community Managers / Developer Experience" as their sole, full-time job. There are many roles that are related, and while we recognize their contributions, we do not class them as a DevRel Practitioner. These could include those who:

- as an adjacent or separate function of their full time role, run a meetup group or organization; or
- perfors some tasks which may involve writing blog posts, speaking at some events, and others, while also primarily filling a different role in their company, like:
  - Software Engineer
  - Product Manager
  - C-level
  - Product Marketing
  - Technical Writer

and many more which are not explicitly laid out as DevRel roles.  

Developer Relations is, in its ideal abstract, "paid altruism". Companies pay people in these roles, which include, but are not limited to:

- Developer Advocacy
- Technical Evangelism
- Technical Community Management
- Developer Experience

These roles exist to work with, and for, the broader community of the tech industry. The primary goal is to meet the needs of the technologists in that community as well as deliver feedback internally to employers about gaps and trends in the market or concerning their product that those in the DevRel organization and discipline notice. How this is functionally implemented will vary depending on the type of parent company as well as organizational reporting structure.

The most common employer is a company that is building, maintaining, or has a core business which is otherwise focused on the types of technology used to create and maintain code bases and their supporting infrastructure. For example, these include, but are not limited to, languages, frameworks, SaaS products for the implementation and maintenance of operational technology, cloud providers themselves, and their supporting ecosystems.

All DevRel roles need to have strong relationships with Product, Marketing, and Engineering within their employing company. In general, DevRel practitioners report to one of these three organizations directly, and interfacing with the other two. Practitioners may interact with  Business Development (BizDev) and Sales, but reporting to either of those organizations generally creates conflicts of interest. The reporting structure generally also impacts how the DevRel practitioners meet the needs of the community, being either more product-focused, marketing-focused, or engineering-focused - though never exclusively.

Thus, the area or areas of specialization of the DevRel individual or team will typically be informed by the intersection of the industry needs and the interests and priorities of their employer. As with the reporting structure, the area of interest will never be solely informed by one or the other
