## A Working definition of DevRel

We define a DevRel Practitioner as one who performs the functions above as their sole, full-time job. There are many roles that are related, and while we recognize their contributions we do not class them as a DevRel Practitioner. These could include those who: 
- as an adjacent or separate function of their full time role, runs a meetup group or organization
- performs some tasks which may involve writing blog posts, speaking at some events, and others, while also primarily filling a different role in their company, like: 
   - Software Engineer, 
   - Product Manager, 
   - C-level, 
   - Product Marketing, 
   - Technical Writer, 
and many more which are not explicitly laid out as DevRel roles.
