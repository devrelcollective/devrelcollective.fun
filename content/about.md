## About us
The DevRel Collective exists as a place for DevRel professionals, Community Managers, and others to share resources, learn best practices, support one another, and be amongst our peers. We participate in and nurture communities as our jobs, but we, too need a community of our own. This is that place. We are over **1,800 professionals** (and growing all the time!) from all walks of life and all over the world.

If you're a DevRel Professional and are looking for your people, here we are! Join us!

### Why is this an exclusive group?
We feel it’s important for those of us who are pursuing this career to have a private and safe place to talk about our struggles, offer suggestions and congratulations, seek advice, and create professional relationships with others in the industry. As a result, we limit access to this group to those who are actively engaged in a career in Developer Relations or Community Management.

If you are actively involved in developer communities or event management, we welcome your input on our public Github repos and appreciate your support! Please let us know if there is anything we can do to support you. If you are curious about Developer Relations, whether as a potential career path or as a company, please take a look at the resources listed below and don’t hesitate to ask if you have any questions.
