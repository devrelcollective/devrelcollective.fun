# How our Application Process Works
A brief primer on how we process and evaluate applications to join the [DevRel Collective](https://devrelcollective.fun) Slack community.

## TL;DR
- This group is for active, practicing DevRel Professionals
- The Admin Team is made up of volunteers, doing their best to verify applications and admit new members
- The Admin Team is not looking to *exclude* people, but to *include* DevRel Professionals

## The Process
All Applicants must submit the [application form](https://devrelcollective.typeform.com/to/YnQuVJ). Once an application form is submitted, a member of the Admin team will review the application, typically within two weeks' time.

Direct invites to the Slack group are not allowed by members of the community, and will be rejected automatically. We have found that having a basic application process, overseen by the Admin Team, has been effective in keeping the community cohesive and a 'safe' place to share about being a DevRel.

Applicants who don't have a traditional DevRel title are typically rejected by the application process itself, before an Admin Team Member even sees the application. In those cases, the applicant sees an immediate response from the form itself stating that their application has been rejected, and informing them that they can reach out to the Admin Team with further detailed information if they feel like their application was rejected in error.

> **Note:** We *strongly* discourage simply re-applying and changing one thing on the application in hopes of being admitted. Any attempts to 'game the system' are not looked upon favorably.

If an applicant is a DevRel professional with a non-traditional title, we ask the applicant to select the "Other" option for their current job title. By providing additional context around the DevRel initiatives and tasks they perform as a member of their DevRel team, applicants have an opportunity to provide the Admin Team with the information necessary to approve their application.

This is to provide those who are either not clearly in DevRel, or who are DevRel adjacent, an opportunity to tell us about the DevRel responsibilities they have that are otherwise non-obvious, as this can be highly specific to an organization and individuals taking on responsibilities outside of their job title.

When reviewing applications, we try to verify job titles in good faith, especially when that verification could lead to approval. We rely on the applicant to clearly convey their intent to join as an actively practicing DevRel professional.

If an Admin is unable to verify the information in the application, they may reach out to the applicant directly via email for further clarification. If it's been more than 2 weeks since your application, and you haven't received an invite, please check your email (and junk mail folder!) for any follow-up correspondence from the Admin Team regarding your application.

If an applicant misrepresents themselves on their application, we reserve the right to deny their application without comment.

Typically, DevRel management and higher - including VPs and C-levels - are a “no”. While we value their knowledge, some of the Q&A that can come up in this Slack team can involve requesting assistance with office politics - something that we’ve heard members of this group explicitly say would be difficult if their managers were also members.

We have found that this group is best suited for those who are actively doing DevRel activities in their day-to-day job, not just managing DevRel Teams.

> **Note:** If your application is approved you will be sent an invite to join the Slack community. Slack invites are valid for approximately 90 days. If you have not accepted your invitation in that time and your invitation expires you will need to re-apply.

We look forward to your [application](https://devrelcollective.typeform.com/to/YnQuVJ)
